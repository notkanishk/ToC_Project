## Basic Algebraic Lexer and Parser
The project requires [`PLY`](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/index.html) and [`TkInter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to work.

The file `CalcCLI.py` is the command line only version which takes in an expression and returns the equivalent result and the parse tree for that expression.

The file `CalcGUI.py` is the graphical calculator which takes input from keyboard as well as clickable buttons and returns the equivalent result and the parse tree for that expression.
